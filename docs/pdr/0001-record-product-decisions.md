# 1. Record product decisions

Date: 2018-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the product decisions made on this project, including the context, rationale and date. This will help maintain common understanding across the wider project team, and enable us to review past decisions when the context or the basis for a decision change.

## Decision

We will capture Product Decisions in the same way as we do Architecture Decisions. https://github.com/Crown-Commercial-Service/ReportMI-ADRs. We will not capture day-to-day decisions, but those material to the product direction, scope, or approach.

In particular, we recognise that decisions can be proposed and accepted, as well as deprecated or superseded, as we continue to iterate and learn.

## Consequences

None
